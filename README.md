# TechNova-Game Context
Our game **Burn!** is inspired by the recent rapid forest fires that have been happening around Canada, which have taken away endless precious natural resources. Do you know that forest fires destroy 148 billion and 30% of emissions?? 
Yet, it has not been getting as much attention as it should have...

Since forest fires destroy a lot of wildlife, we created this game to raise awareness of the destruction of forest fires.
The characters, Aurora and Byte, start walking in a peaceful forest when there are suddenly serious wildfires, and the environment ends in disaster. 
From there, Aurora has to either return to the firey disaster or move to the next scenario. 

What should Aurora and Byte choose? Play the game to help her find out!!
