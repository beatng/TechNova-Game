# TechNova-Game Context
Our game **Burn**! is inspired by the recent rapid forest fires that have been happening around Canada, which have taken away endless precious natural resources.
Yet it has not been getting as much attention as it should have 
Do you know that forest fires destroy 148 billion and 30% of emissions?? 
Since forest fires destroy a lot of wildlife, which is why we created this game to raise awareness of the destruction of forest fires 
The character. Aurora and Byte start walking in a peaceful forest when there are suddenly serious wildfires, and the environment ends in disaster. 
From there, Aurora has to choose either to go back to the firey disaster or move to the next scenario. 
What should Nova choose? Play the game to help her find out!!
